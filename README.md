# NorthwindREST
Northwind REST API

This is a Java Spring REST API project made over the Northwind database.
It allows the user to view data about either the Products,
Employees, or the Orders. The user can specify parameters 
by searching for things like the name, id, etc. 

For future iterations of this project, I would like to
implement error handling and join certain tables to 
make the data more relevant.
